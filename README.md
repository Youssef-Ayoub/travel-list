# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

**Travel List**
**Project Overview: Developed a Travel List application using JavaScript and React, designed to help users manage their packing lists efficiently.
**Key Features:**
**Form Handling:** Implemented a form that allows users to add items to their travel list with a specified number and text description.
**Interactive List:** Each added item includes a checkbox to mark it as packed or unpacked.
**Footer Stats:** Displayed real-time statistics showing the number of packed items and the percentage of items packed.
**React Concepts Utilized:**
Component Creation and Reuse: Built modular and reusable components for the form, list, and footer stats.
Props and State Management: Managed the state of the list items and their packed status using React’s state and props.
Conditional Rendering: Applied conditional rendering to dynamically update the UI based on the state.
JSX: Used JSX for structuring and rendering the components.
State Management: Employed React’s useState hook to manage the state of the travel items and their packing status.
